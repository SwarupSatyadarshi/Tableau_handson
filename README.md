This is a part of my tableau hands on experience.
Using the Sample Superstore data I have prepared the following visualizations

1- Region based subcategory wise top 3 Sales 
2- Statewise measurement with distinct column coloring
3- Benford's Law
4- User defined table enhancement using parameters
5- Map with multiple Layers
6- Multiple KPI donut chart region wise profit analysis
